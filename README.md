- **Aragon gov-ui-kit** — OSS component library for building governance UIs → https://github.com/aragon/gov-ui-kit
- **Aragon app** — on-chain governance app (legacy, but a lot of learnings) → https://github.com/aragon/app
- **Web3Privacy Now** — regular contributor (privacy nerd) → https://web3privacy.info/

## Now

- Working on bridging + staking UX + web3 UI/UX at Polygon
- Playing with AI/agents + CLI/TUI tooling
- Open to connecting with like-minded builders + mentoring folks breaking into tech/web3
