# 👋 Hey, I’m Asam | Shan8851.eth

Full stack engineer building DAO governance and DeFi tooling at [Aragon](https://aragon.org).  
Curious about modular governance, onchain UX, and all things open-source.  
Currently diving deeper into Solidity, system design, and backend infrastructure.

## 🔨 What I’m Working On

- 🧩 [Modular Governance UI @ Aragon](https://app.aragon.org) – interfaces for composable DAO flows
- 🤝 Contributor to [Web3Privacy Now](https://github.com/web3privacy) – building tools for a more private Ethereum
- 🔮 [EtherPoll](https://ether-poll-app.vercel.app/) - Vote on the hottest topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. Zero noise. All signal.
- ⚙💰 [OnchainTips]([https://github.com/shan8851/last-ping-contract](https://github.com/shan8851/onchain-tips)) – Smart contract fro receiving tips in eth and ERC20 tokens

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- 🧱 **Solidity + Foundry** – testing strategies, gas optimization, and fuzzing
- 🏗 **Smart Contract Architecture** – modularity, upgradeability, permissioning patterns
- 🧰 **Backend & Infra** – hands-on with Docker, CI/CD, Postgres, GraphQL, and Rust
- 🧬 **Governance Mechanics** – voting escrow, gauges, dynamic voting power, RWA-based DAOs
