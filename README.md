# 👋 Hey, I’m Asam

Senior full stack engineer @ Polygon — on a mission to move all money on-chain.
Building and shipping AI-powered products, prompt workflows, and automation systems.

- **ExcuseMe** — AI-first excuse generator with tone controls, fallback safety, and optional context → https://excuse-me.xyz/
- **Agglayer UI** — bridging UI for Agglayer chains (and back) → https://ui.agglayer.dev/
- **Aragon gov-ui-kit** — OSS component library for building governance UIs → https://github.com/aragon/gov-ui-kit

## Projects

## Now
- moving all money onchain at Polygon
- building automated workflows for day-to-day operations
- playing too much with OpenClaw while helping the uninitiated use AI to its full potential

I’m looking for a small, high-signal builder community to learn and ship with. Hit me up.
