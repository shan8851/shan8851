# 👋 Hey, I’m Asam | Shan8851.eth

I'm a full stack engineer building DAO governance and DeFi tooling at [Aragon](https://aragon.org).  
Curious about modular governance, onchain UX, and all things open-source.  
Currently levelling up on Solidity, system design, and backend infra.

---

## 🔨 Currently Building

- 🛠 [Modular Governance Frontend @ Aragon](https://app.aragon.org) – interfaces for custom DAO flows
- 🔮 [EtherPoll](https://ether-poll-app.vercel.app/) - Vote on the hottest topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. Zero noise. All signal.
- ⚙️ [_sepoSip](https://sepo-sip.vercel.app) – Sepolia faucet with leaderboard & smart contract donations  
---

## 🧠 Currently Learning

- 🧱 Solidity + Foundry – digging into smart contract testing and gas efficiency
- 🏗 Smart contract architecture – patterns for modularity, upgradeability and permissioning
- 🧰 Backend & infra – improving skills with Docker, CI/CD, Postgres, GraphQL and Rust
- 🧠 Governance mechanics – exploring voting escrow, gauges and RWA-based DAO models
